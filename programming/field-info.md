# Field Information

## Welded vs. AndyMark

The Welded field and the AndyMark field have ever so slight differences that matter for things like using the pose from Apriltags. Some competition locations have the Welded field and some have the AndyMark field.

Which field version a location uses is in the Game Manual.
